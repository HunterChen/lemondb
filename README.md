lemondb - Extensible MongoDB [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcuadros/lemondb.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mcuadros/lemondb)
==============================

The main goal of lemondb (*extensibLE MONgoDB*) is provide a way to extend mongodb with new features. Currently this project is more of an experiment than a serious project.

lemondb is based on the great work of [Naitik Shah](https://github.com/daaku) in [dvara](https://github.com/facebookgo/dvara) a connection pooling proxy for mongodb.
